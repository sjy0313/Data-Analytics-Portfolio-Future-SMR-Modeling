## Projects

### 1. 📚 Consumer Trend Analytics (Post-COVID)
**"Text mining & correlation analysis of online bookstore sales data"**

* **Summary:** Analyzed book sales data before and after COVID-19 to understand changes in consumer psychology and interests (e.g. "Corona Blue").
* **Applied Mathematics & Statistics Connection:**
    * **Correlation Analysis:** Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to measure the strength of the relationship between pandemic waves and book category sales.
    * **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarized large datasets to identify central tendencies and dispersion in consumer behavior.
* **Key Results:**
    * Identified a surge in "Self-Development" and "Economics/Business" book sales, correlating with the social phenomenon of "Corona Blue and surge in the value of real assets"
    * Provided data-driven marketing insights for online bookstores.
* **Tech:** `Python(pandas/Numpy/Selenium)`, `PowerBI`
 **Data_Reference:** https://www.kyobobook.co.kr/ (Korean Online Bookstore holding Seond largest market share in Korea)

### 2. 🏙️ Urban Polarization Analysis (Spatial Big Data)
**"Analyzing the gap between housing prices and infrastructure between Chungcheongdo region and sejong"**

* **Summary:** Investigated the correlation between housing transaction indices and urban infrastructure (schools, hospitals) using spatial big data.
* **Applied Mathematics & Statistics Connection:**
    * **Regression Analysis:** Built linear regression models to quantify the relationship between infrastructure accessibility and housing prices.
                            **PCA(Principal Component Analysis)**,**Confusion Matrix", "One-hot encoding/Label encoding"  metrics to validate predictive power.
    * **Model Evaluation:** assessed model performance using **R-squared**, **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**, 
    * **Spatial Statistics:** Analyzed spatial distribution patterns of wealth and infrastructure.
* **Key Results:**
    * **R² = 0.968**: Proved a strong positive correlation between infrastructure density and housing prices.
    * Visualized the "Polarization" phenomenon where resources are heavily concentrated in specific urban clusters (Sejong/Daejeon).
* **Tech:** `Python(Tensorflow/scipy/matplotlib/plotly)`, `Regression Modeling`, 'MySQL'
* **Data_Reference:**`Spatial Analysis(https://hogangnono.com/apt/5fd46/0/2)-> Hogangnono is a web service that provides detailed real estate information for property buyers and investors`

### 3. 📉 Local Extinction Crisis Analysis & Prediction
**"Predicting regional extinction risks using Machine Learning Ensemble Models"**

* **Summary:** Analyzed demographic data to identify regions at risk of local extinction and developed a classification model to predict risk levels.
* **Applied Mathematics & Statistics Connection:**
    * **Multicollinearity Analysis (VIF):** Applied Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect and remove highly correlated independent variables, ensuring the stability of the regression coefficients.
    * **Ensemble Learning:** Utilized **Gradient Boosting (GBM)** and **Random Forest** algorithms, leveraging the law of large numbers to reduce variance and overfitting.
    * **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Used **RandomizedSearchCV** to find the optimal global solution in the parameter space.
* **Key Results:**
    * Achieved high classification accuracy (F1-Score optimized) for identifying high-risk regions.
    * Identified key factors contributing to population decline (e.g., lack of medical/educational infrastructure).
* **Tech:** `Python Scikit-learn', `VIF Analysis`, 'Cross Validation'
